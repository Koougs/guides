Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) is a character coded set developed by The Unicode Consortium. A character coded set is a set of characters that are associated with a numbered code, that a computer can understand. Unicode allows for more languages other than English, to encode character sets. <sup> Character Encoding reflects the way the coded character set is mapped to bytes for manipulation in a computer. </sup>

Unicode was developed to replace the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII, pronounced As-Key). ASCII was developed with mainly English characters in mind and can not fully support other written languages such as Chinese characters. Developing with UTF-8 allows you to support other languages when building a program or app, something that was not considered when ASCII was developed.

UTF can be implemented with different character sets. The two most common are UTF-8 and UTF-16

<sup>UTF-8, A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web page.</sup>

<sup>UTF-16, 16-bit Unicode Transformation Format is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode, capable of encoding the entire Unicode repertoire. UTF-16 is used in major operating systems and environments, like Microsoft Windows, Java and .NET.</sup>
