Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It can be run on Microsoft Windows or on Linux.
You use Puppet by inputing the resources and state of your system, which is then stored into a file called Puppet Manifests. Puppet Manifests are compared against a system's configuration; if there are any differences, Puppet reports them. Puppet is available in two versions, Puppet Enterprise and Open Source Puppet. Puppet is useful for automating repetitive tasks and increasing manageability and productivity.
